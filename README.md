#### Why we don't use GitHub Wiki?
GitHub doesn't support pull requests for the wiki repositories.    
We appreciate source code openness as well as documentation opens.  
We believe each one community member should have the possibility to improve documentation and propose important enhancements. 
So, we decide to use plain markdown in classic repositories for the documentation purposes.
